<h3>Trying to correct twitter data</h3>



<p>Today I found I can use cloud server to run this program and it makes easier the project.</p>



<p>However, since Twitter&#8217;s problem, I can&#8217;t verify my twtter developer account for last few days (I&#8217;m writing this on Jan 5). So I just read and summarize on current news about &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; for next few days.</p>



<p><strong><em>Updated on Jan 8</em></strong><br>Finally Twitter sent me the verification code, so I run the code below. However it said I need Elevated access to run this script, so I am now requesting Eleveted API access for Twitter. FAQ and developer forum suggests it usually takes less than a week.</p>



<p>For example, I will run the script below to correct tweets related to &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>gathertw.sh -l ja -o ja --sincedt=20220707 -c -- 統一 OR 統一教会 OR 文鮮明 OR 韓鶴子 OR 家庭連合 OR 祝福2世 OR 祝福二世 OR 祝福２世</code></pre>

<h3>Correcting Twitter data as a piece of public opinion</h3>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>From today, I am going to work on correcting Twitter posts related to &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and &#8220;Second Generation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.ipsj.or.jp/dp/contents/publication/41/S1101-R1802.html#link12">this</a> project, I will use &#8220;Kotoriotoko&#8221; to gather twitter posts. This is open source software build by Japanese scholars, and seems easy to run. However, since I aim to gather two different but overlapping concepts, I need two separate computers that can run this program 24/7. Fortunately I have one old computer that I barely use, so first computer would be that one. For my second computer, I could buy new small computer for this research using new year discounts or borrow unused computer from group home.</p>



<p>I could not verify my phone number to Twitter account which I want to use, so I am going to get another phone number for this project and one-month trip to Japan.</p>
