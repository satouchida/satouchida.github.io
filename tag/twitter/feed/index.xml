<h4>Jan 3</h4>



<p>Today I found I can use cloud services to run this program, making the project easier.</p>



<p>However, since Twitter&#8217;s problem, I can&#8217;t verify my Twitter developer account for the last few days (I&#8217;m writing this on Jan 5). So I just read and summarized on current news about &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; for the next few days.</p>



<p><strong><em>Updated on Jan 8</em></strong><br>Finally, Twitter sent me the verification code, so I ran the code below. However, it said I need Elevated access to run this script, so I am now requesting Elevated API access for Twitter. FAQ and developer forum suggests it usually takes less than a week.</p>



<p>For example, I will run the script below to correct tweets related to &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>gathertw.sh -l ja -o ja --sincedt=20220707 -c -- 統一 OR 統一教会 OR 文鮮明 OR 韓鶴子 OR 家庭連合 OR 祝福2世 OR 祝福二世 OR 祝福２世</code></pre>

<p>From today, I am going to work on correcting Twitter posts related to &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and &#8220;Second Generation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Based on this project, I will use &#8220;Kotoriotoko&#8221; to gather Twitter posts. This is open-source software built by Japanese scholars and seems easy to run. However, since I aim to gather two different but overlapping concepts, I need two separate computers that can run this program 24/7. Fortunately, I have one old computer I barely use, so the first one would be that one. For my second computer, I could buy a new small computer for this research using new year&#8217;s discounts or borrow an unused computer from a group home.</p>



<p>I could not verify my phone number for a Twitter account, which I want to use, so I am going to get another phone number for this project and a one-month trip to Japan.</p>
