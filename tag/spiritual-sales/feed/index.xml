<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My reflection on this reading</h5>



<p>Left-side newspapers tend to criticize conservatives due to &#8220;connection with &#8216;Unification Church&#8217; related organizations,&#8221; however, left-side newspapers often interviewed or introduced &#8220;second-generations&#8221; perspectives. Personally, those &#8220;second generations&#8221; should also be aware of making connections with certain political sides; otherwise, they are doing the same thing as the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jan 5</h4>



<ul>
<li>Since January 4, &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; has been attempted twice by Agency for Cultural Affairs under the control of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).</li>



<li>The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology heard the opinions of an advisory council, Religious Corporations Council.</li>



<li> &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; had been added to the article because of terrorism, mainly the Tokyo subway sarin attack, by Aum Shinrikyo but was never attempted until November 22, 2022.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">What is the right of &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; or &#8220;questioning right&#8221;</h5>



<p>This right can be exercised if the one who is in a religious organization continuously violates the law or the organization causes serious damage.<br>After examining reports, the minister of MEXT can ask for the order of dissolution of the religious organization for the court. When the court finds a cause, it may order the dissolution of the religious corporation.</p>



<p>The contents of reports and questions will not publish for a certain period because of &#8220;privacy for both sides.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">First Attempt</h5>



<p>The first attempt had excused on November 22, 2022. Based on MEXT, they asked for &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; to answer about the documents related to the operation of the organization, statements, documents, and accounting books related to their assets.</p>



<p>The agency received the answer for Cultural Affairs on December 9, 2022. However, the Agency said the reports from &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; were not enough, so they re-attempted the right on December 14, 2022, again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Second Attempt</h5>



<p>Since the first attempt could not gain enough information from the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; the Agency for Cultural Affairs re-attempted to exercise &#8220;questioning right&#8221; for the church.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Abstract</h2>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Background Concepts</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The child guidance center must take action, including temporary custody, to secure the child&#8217;s safety when a custodian commits &#8220;child abuse&#8221; (used in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act) based on the faith of particular religion or belief system (Inspiration or any other method that is almost impossible to demonstrate and that arouses personal fear.)</p>



<p>When the center finds a possibility of ongoing child abuse, they are required to judge comprehensively, including the situations of children and custodians, such as living environment, rather than following examples from the Q&amp;A section. The judgment must be made by the children&#8217;s side.</p>
</blockquote>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The response for those other than custodians</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Abuse of a child could be punished by applying Penal Code such as Assault, Indecency through Compulsion, Abandonment by a Person Responsible for Their Care, and anyone dictating or advising these acts for custodians could constitute co-principals, inducements, or accessories; thus, one should accuse the case for police timely.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Points to be considered for response to abuse and encouraging independence</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Children who experience</em></strong> abuse related to religion may be strongly affected by religious doctrine and find it hard to recognize and appeal to their situation, which has problems—assessing their environment objectively and explaining or instructing the definition of child abuse for children and guardians.<br>However, <strong><em>because the guidance might not be enough to change the behavior or thoughts of custodians based on religious doctrine against children, and there are concerns that the escalation of abusing by custodians or intervening for a family from religious organizations with the guidance as a trigger</em></strong>, securing the children&#8217;s safety is the priority so that taking temporary custody pursuant without hesitation will be necessary if needed.</li>



<li>Suppose those who the age over 18 years old come to talk about their problem, introducing the use of Youth Independent Assistance Homes (kind of group home) and discussing the next steps following their mind is required. If they do not seek to use Youth Independent Assistance Homes, <strong><em>proactive outreach</em></strong> is required despite their age (in japan, youths over 18 years are considered adults). List and organize their particular problems and build a connection with the Japan Legal Support Center, welfare offices, or other related institutions/organizations.</li>



<li>In case of judging whether each issue is child abuse or not, the child guidance center must make a decision examining multiple sides such as children&#8217;s condition, guardians&#8217; condition, and living environments; thus, <strong><em>it can be child abuse if there are only minor actions</em></strong>.</li>

<p>As I did yesterday, I would like to continue to catch up on the current situation of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related issues in Japan. For today, I am going to focus on the press conferences and the announcements by the Church. It is a rare opportunity for us to grasp what they perceive and think about the problem, especially related to the &#8220;second generation.&#8221;</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">First Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on July 11th, about an hour</li>



<li>Describe the official view of Mr. Abe&#8217;s assassination of the Church</li>
</ul>



<p>They excused themselves by explaining their doctrine and claimed their innocence for the assassination.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Second Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on August 10th, about an hour</li>



<li>Their claim for spiritual sales and their political activities</li>
</ul>



<p>At the press conference, the president of the Japanese &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Tomihiro Tanaka, made it clear that they are no more committing to spiritual sales, which was once a social problem in Japan about 40 years ago. He also resorted to the Church getting unreasonable discrimination and hatred rooted in &#8220;biased reporting&#8221; by the media. He said the current environment surrounding the Church violates freedom of religion.</p>



<p>When he talked about &#8220;biased coverage,&#8221; he pointed out that the media only convey the thoughts of &#8220;ex-Moonies&#8221; while omitting the viewpoints or &#8220;success stories&#8221; of pious Moonies.</p>
