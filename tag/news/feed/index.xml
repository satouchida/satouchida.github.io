										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today I met with my friend, who is studying at International Christian University as a senior. She finally decided to major in Anthropology, but she was also interested in advocation for children. She has worked on Save the Children Japan and advocated for educating the treatment of children&#8217;s rights.</p>



<p>We talked about many things, especially those related to our future careers. Because she is a senior, she has been working on job applications while I have just finished my first semester as a college student. But one thing we have in common: the undescribable anxiety for our future. Thus we spent a lot of time on this topic.</p>



<p>Anyway, about spiritual abuse. She seemed to focus more on supporting while the child is in the family and after the child leaves their family. Since I have experienced living in a group home, she talked about the quality of a group home.</p>



<p>My group home is awesome &#8211; of course, I am biased. But I heard very bad rumors from other group homes and rarely saw news articles reporting abuse in the group home, which should be a safe place for children.</p>



<p>And she said, &#8220;I guess some welfare workers treat children badly because they think of themselves as &#8216;who are helping the misery child&#8217; to some extent.&#8221; I agree with that. However, I do not know how to prevent that kind of person from getting a position in the group home. In Japan, almost any kind of welfare institution is always recruiting workers despite not having enough money to run the group home easily.</p>



<p>My group home, though, have a lot of money and has some lawyers working for children. The founder of the corporation which runs my group home seems very good at finding and gathering the people they need. But not every corporation is like that. Some institutions are suffering from a lack of money. Others are doing everything they can to hire. We concluded we should consider these problems while discussing treating spiritually abused children.</p>

<li>2022 Feb, no articles mentioning this topic</li>



<li>2022 Mar, some articles touched on the concept of &#8220;family,&#8221; which seems deeply affected by doctrines of the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; yet did not mention the term &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</li>



<li>no mention of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; until 2022 Oct
<ul>
<li>2022 Oct, mentioned &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; in some articles</li>



<li>One mentioned the relationships between religious corporations and LDP since LDP is currently making a coalition with New Komeito, which has Soka Gakkai (Buddhism New Religious Movement in Japan) as a power base</li>



<li>One justified its relationships with the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; arguing how the impact of the church was small for the ruling party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)</li>



<li>One criticized both right and left wings for this problem while partly praising the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related organizations&#8217; works, primarily related to N. Korea&#8217;s kidnapping of the Japanese.</li>
</ul>

<p>After Oct 2022, we have not discussed &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and its related issues.</p>

<li>They worked hard for this problem, but it may be because &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; has cooperated with LDP, and generally, Akahata newspaper tends to criticize LDP.</li>

<h5>My reflection on this reading</h5>



<p>Left-side newspapers tend to criticize conservatives due to &#8220;connection with &#8216;Unification Church&#8217; related organizations,&#8221; however, left-side newspapers often interviewed or introduced &#8220;second-generations&#8221; perspectives. Personally, those &#8220;second generations&#8221; should also be aware of making connections with certain political sides; otherwise, they are doing the same thing as the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did.</p>

<p>The man claimed that Toyama city congressman and congresswoman refused his proposal to bring his petition against this resolution, which violates the right to petition, the fundamental part of democracy.</p>

<h4>&#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; &#8211; Religious Corporations Act Article 78-2</h4>



<ul>
<li>Since January 4, &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; has been attempted twice by Agency for Cultural Affairs under the control of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).</li>



<li>The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology heard the opinions of an advisory council, Religious Corporations Council.</li>



<li> &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; had been added to the article because of terrorism, mainly the Tokyo subway sarin attack, by Aum Shinrikyo but was never attempted until November 22, 2022.</li>
</ul>



<h5>What is the right of &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; or &#8220;questioning right&#8221;</h5>



<p>This right can be exercised if the one who is in a religious organization continuously violates the law or the organization causes serious damage.<br>After examining reports, the minister of MEXT can ask for the order of dissolution of the religious organization for the court. When the court finds a cause, it may order the dissolution of the religious corporation.</p>



<p>The contents of reports and questions will not publish for a certain period because of &#8220;privacy for both sides.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>First Attempt</h5>



<p>The first attempt had excused on November 22, 2022. Based on MEXT, they asked for &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; to answer about the documents related to the operation of the organization, statements, documents, and accounting books related to their assets.</p>



<p>The agency received the answer for Cultural Affairs on December 9, 2022. However, the Agency said the reports from &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; were not enough, so they re-attempted the right on December 14, 2022, again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>Second Attempt</h5>



<p>Since the first attempt could not gain enough information from the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; the Agency for Cultural Affairs re-attempted to exercise &#8220;questioning right&#8221; for the church.</p>

</ul>



<p>At this conference, the church changed its statement about spiritual sales. They confirmed there are &#8220;very little numbers&#8221; of spiritual sales cases because the National Consumer Affairs of Japan announced there are cases related to spiritual sales by &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221; Also, they revealed a newly established standard for donation, which is 30% of the monthly salary. They also introduced &#8220;Family Counselors&#8221; who help pious families.</p>

<h3>Read News Articles and Press Conferences by &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Day 2</h3>



<p>As I did yesterday, I would like to continue to catch up on the current situation of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related issues in Japan. For today, I am going to focus on the press conferences and the announcements by the Church. It is a rare opportunity for us to grasp what they perceive and think about the problem, especially related to the &#8220;second generation.&#8221;</p>

<h5>First Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on July 11th, about an hour</li>



<li>Describe the official view of Mr. Abe&#8217;s assassination of the Church</li>
</ul>



<p>They excused themselves by explaining their doctrine and claimed their innocence for the assassination.</p>

<h5>Second Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on August 10th, about an hour</li>



<li>Their claim for spiritual sales and their political activities</li>
</ul>



<p>At the press conference, the president of the Japanese &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Tomihiro Tanaka, made it clear that they are no more committing to spiritual sales, which was once a social problem in Japan about 40 years ago. He also resorted to the Church getting unreasonable discrimination and hatred rooted in &#8220;biased reporting&#8221; by the media. He said the current environment surrounding the Church violates freedom of religion.</p>



<p>When he talked about &#8220;biased coverage,&#8221; he pointed out that the media only convey the thoughts of &#8220;ex-Moonies&#8221; while omitting the viewpoints or &#8220;success stories&#8221; of pious Moonies.</p>

<h3>Read News Articles and Press Conferences by &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; &#8211; Day 1</h3>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>Since I have not been in Japan for about four months, I am not knowledgeable about the current situation in Japan. Thus, I decided to read some articles about the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; from mainstream media.</p>



<p>Before starting my journal, I would like to convey the use of the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; in Japan. Pious believers of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; are known as &#8220;Moonies&#8221; in English, and they changed their name to &#8220;The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification&#8221; for the sake of erasing its notoriety. However, because the term &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; is widely recognized in Japan, the media continues to use &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the next five to eight days, I will read as many Japanese articles for several fields and summarize them in English. The summarization would be the journal for the first days of Japan since</p>



<ol>
<li>Prevent spreading COVID, R.S.V., flu around by interviewing people in-person;</li>



<li>Re-capping current Japanese media&#8217;s attitude towards the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and its related problems;</li>



<li>Jet lag might not allow me to behave like those in Japan.</li>
</ol>



<p>Today, I will focus on the dynamic changes in the media&#8217;s way of presenting this issue to the public.</p>



<p>The situation surrounding media have been shifting quickly. Before I left Japan, most of the media didn&#8217;t mention the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Instead, they called it &#8220;the Religious Group.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know why they didn&#8217;t say about the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; despite the media from the US or Europe mentioning the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; or &#8220;Moonies&#8221; at that moment. However, this weird regard didn&#8217;t last long.</p>



<p>On July 11, the head of the Church&#8217;s Japanese organization held a press conference to express their official statements with a &#8220;selected&#8221; medium. After the first conference, all the TVs and newspapers started using &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; because they could finally convey both sides&#8217; information about the problem. After the conference, the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; organized some panels, so tomorrow, I will focus on these events and other announcements from the Church.</p>
