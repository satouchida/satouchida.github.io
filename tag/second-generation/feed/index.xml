<h3>Jan 17</h3>



<p>After I graduated from high school, I made an appointment with one professor who are specialized in mind control by &#8220;cults&#8221; such as Aum or &#8220;Unificaiton Church.&#8221; He is very kind for me, and he invited me to join one of his classes for graduate students.</p>



<p>It was before the assasination of Shinzo Abe, so I was just one of the rare example of those who have experienced spiritual abuse by parents and luckly Japanese Child Consultation Center (CPS-like organization) decided to took me from my parents. I learned many things from he and his students. How to investigate the impact of spiritual abuse or the existance of research center that focuses on conspiracy theory is the examples.</p>



<p>It is final period in Japan, so he and his students seemed very busy but they were warmly accepted me. One of his student are working on investigating the longer effect of spiritual abuse by surveying former followers of &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Happy Sciences, and some other new religions in Japan. I briefly reviewed the draft of questionere, and gave some advice in the use of languages.</p>



<p>After that, me and professor talked about current situation. He worried about the decrease of public interest against &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and spiritual abuse since currently Japanese government seems they want to stop discussing about this problem more because they made &#8220;rescue bill,&#8221; which he thinks not enough. But he worked for the guideline for Spiritual and close sorts of Child Abuses by MHLW, and both of us feels it is enough to help children and youths who are suffering.</p>



<p>However, since he is a Social Psychologist, he knows there are few psychologists who can deal with this kind of complex problem. Because of that, he now aims to seek the way to increase the number of psychologists who have basic knowledge about religion and spiritual abuse through their education while trying to increase the number of students who want to be a psychologist.</p>



<p>Finally he said it is very precious that I, who have been experienced spiritual abuse and its after effects while interested in spiritual abuse and advocating individual rights, am studying outside Japan because this studying opportunity will give me new perspective that cannot be gaind from Japan. I don&#8217;t know how or if I contribute to this problem so far, but definetly I can work for that in the future.</p>

<h4>Jan 15</h4>



<p>We met at nearest shopping center of us. She is one of the referee of me when I won scholarship from Japanese foundation, and she have been worked for me since I joined my previous residence after I left my home. We have kept in touch during fall semester, so it is natural for both of us to meet in person.</p>



<p>At the table, we mainly talked about our shared interest: spiritual abuse from the parents. Because of the publication of the guideline for Spiritual and close sorts of Child Abuses by the government, we discussed about that while talking about my curennt academic interest and college life in general. Both of us appriciate the guideline since it will certainly help those who are suffering spiritual abuse, but we worried about the lack of experts who can deal with this irregular types of abuses.</p>



<p>Also while I worried about the politicalization of the argument about &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and spiritual abuse, she accepts its politicalization because she believes it is the best and fastest way to rescue those who are suffering.</p>



<p>When it comes to political standpoints of us, I feel I am little bit of conservative left while she seems liberal of liberal. Because of that she is wholeheartedly working for advocating children&#8217;s rights. I also wish to expand children&#8217;s rights, but I don&#8217;t feel current Japanese situation is healthy. It seems like Japanese ruling and opposit parties are depending on one-side information and purging one religious corporation. Despite the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; has been decieved many people through spiritual sales and illegal preaching, it is one of the certified religious coporations in Japan and I think I should respect it while enforcing law against its illegal behaviors.</p>



<p>Because of this kind of thought, I decided to read right-wing magazines and seek around what Japanese right-wings are thinking about this problem. When I told this plan for her, she was interested in that and said please teach me when you find something interesting.</p>



<p>It was only dinner, so we couldn&#8217;t talk much. But I think I found some interesting different perspective from her. This short but prolific conversation, I decided to focus on the interest for this problem based on right/left wings.</p>

<p>Today I met with my friend, who is studying at International Christian University as a senior. She finally decided to major in Anthropology, but she was also interested in advocation for children. She has worked on Save the Children Japan and advocated for educating the treatment of children&#8217;s rights.</p>



<p>We talked about many things, especially those related to our future careers. Because she is a senior, she has been working on job applications while I have just finished my first semester as a college student. But one thing we have in common: the undescribable anxiety for our future. Thus we spent a lot of time on this topic.</p>



<p>Anyway, about spiritual abuse. She seemed to focus more on supporting while the child is in the family and after the child leaves their family. Since I have experienced living in a group home, she talked about the quality of a group home.</p>



<p>My group home is awesome &#8211; of course, I am biased. But I heard very bad rumors from other group homes and rarely saw news articles reporting abuse in the group home, which should be a safe place for children.</p>



<p>And she said, &#8220;I guess some welfare workers treat children badly because they think of themselves as &#8216;who are helping the misery child&#8217; to some extent.&#8221; I agree with that. However, I do not know how to prevent that kind of person from getting a position in the group home. In Japan, almost any kind of welfare institution is always recruiting workers despite not having enough money to run the group home easily.</p>



<p>My group home, though, have a lot of money and has some lawyers working for children. The founder of the corporation which runs my group home seems very good at finding and gathering the people they need. But not every corporation is like that. Some institutions are suffering from a lack of money. Others are doing everything they can to hire. We concluded we should consider these problems while discussing treating spiritually abused children.</p>

<h5>My reflection on this reading</h5>



<p>Left-side newspapers tend to criticize conservatives due to &#8220;connection with &#8216;Unification Church&#8217; related organizations,&#8221; however, left-side newspapers often interviewed or introduced &#8220;second-generations&#8221; perspectives. Personally, those &#8220;second generations&#8221; should also be aware of making connections with certain political sides; otherwise, they are doing the same thing as the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did.</p>

<h4>&#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; &#8211; Religious Corporations Act Article 78-2</h4>



<ul>
<li>Since January 4, &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; has been attempted twice by Agency for Cultural Affairs under the control of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).</li>



<li>The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology heard the opinions of an advisory council, Religious Corporations Council.</li>



<li> &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; had been added to the article because of terrorism, mainly the Tokyo subway sarin attack, by Aum Shinrikyo but was never attempted until November 22, 2022.</li>
</ul>



<h5>What is the right of &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; or &#8220;questioning right&#8221;</h5>



<p>This right can be exercised if the one who is in a religious organization continuously violates the law or the organization causes serious damage.<br>After examining reports, the minister of MEXT can ask for the order of dissolution of the religious organization for the court. When the court finds a cause, it may order the dissolution of the religious corporation.</p>



<p>The contents of reports and questions will not publish for a certain period because of &#8220;privacy for both sides.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>First Attempt</h5>



<p>The first attempt had excused on November 22, 2022. Based on MEXT, they asked for &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; to answer about the documents related to the operation of the organization, statements, documents, and accounting books related to their assets.</p>



<p>The agency received the answer for Cultural Affairs on December 9, 2022. However, the Agency said the reports from &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; were not enough, so they re-attempted the right on December 14, 2022, again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>Second Attempt</h5>



<p>Since the first attempt could not gain enough information from the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; the Agency for Cultural Affairs re-attempted to exercise &#8220;questioning right&#8221; for the church.</p>

<h3>Correcting Twitter data as a piece of public opinion</h3>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>From today, I am going to work on correcting Twitter posts related to &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and &#8220;Second Generation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Based on this project, I will use &#8220;Kotoriotoko&#8221; to gather Twitter posts. This is open-source software built by Japanese scholars and seems easy to run. However, since I aim to gather two different but overlapping concepts, I need two separate computers that can run this program 24/7. Fortunately, I have one old computer I barely use, so the first one would be that one. For my second computer, I could buy a new small computer for this research using new year&#8217;s discounts or borrow an unused computer from a group home.</p>



<p>I could not verify my phone number for a Twitter account, which I want to use, so I am going to get another phone number for this project and a one-month trip to Japan.</p>

<h2>1. Abstract</h2>



<h5>Background Concepts</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The child guidance center must take action, including temporary custody, to secure the child&#8217;s safety when a custodian commits &#8220;child abuse&#8221; (used in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act) based on the faith of particular religion or belief system (Inspiration or any other method that is almost impossible to demonstrate and that arouses personal fear.)</p>



<p>When the center finds a possibility of ongoing child abuse, they are required to judge comprehensively, including the situations of children and custodians, such as living environment, rather than following examples from the Q&amp;A section. The judgment must be made by the children&#8217;s side.</p>
</blockquote>



<h5>The response for those other than custodians</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Abuse of a child could be punished by applying Penal Code such as Assault, Indecency through Compulsion, Abandonment by a Person Responsible for Their Care, and anyone dictating or advising these acts for custodians could constitute co-principals, inducements, or accessories; thus, one should accuse the case for police timely.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-bjork-angled-separator-wide"/>



<h2>3. Points to be considered for response to abuse and encouraging independence</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>Children who experience</em></strong> abuse related to religion may be strongly affected by religious doctrine and find it hard to recognize and appeal to their situation, which has problems—assessing their environment objectively and explaining or instructing the definition of child abuse for children and guardians.<br>However, <strong><em>because the guidance might not be enough to change the behavior or thoughts of custodians based on religious doctrine against children, and there are concerns that the escalation of abusing by custodians or intervening for a family from religious organizations with the guidance as a trigger</em></strong>, securing the children&#8217;s safety is the priority so that taking temporary custody pursuant without hesitation will be necessary if needed.</li>



<li>Suppose those who the age over 18 years old come to talk about their problem, introducing the use of Youth Independent Assistance Homes (kind of group home) and discussing the next steps following their mind is required. If they do not seek to use Youth Independent Assistance Homes, <strong><em>proactive outreach</em></strong> is required despite their age (in japan, youths over 18 years are considered adults). List and organize their particular problems and build a connection with the Japan Legal Support Center, welfare offices, or other related institutions/organizations.</li>



<li>In case of judging whether each issue is child abuse or not, the child guidance center must make a decision examining multiple sides such as children&#8217;s condition, guardians&#8217; condition, and living environments; thus, <strong><em>it can be child abuse if there are only minor actions</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
