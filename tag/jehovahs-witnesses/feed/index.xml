<li>2022 Feb, no articles mentioning this topic</li>



<li>2022 Mar, some articles touched on the concept of &#8220;family,&#8221; which seems deeply affected by doctrines of the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; yet did not mention the term &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</li>



<li>no mention of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; until 2022 Oct
<ul>
<li>2022 Oct, mentioned &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; in some articles</li>



<li>One mentioned the relationships between religious corporations and LDP since LDP is currently making a coalition with New Komeito, which has Soka Gakkai (Buddhism New Religious Movement in Japan) as a power base</li>



<li>One justified its relationships with the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; arguing how the impact of the church was small for the ruling party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)</li>



<li>One criticized both right and left wings for this problem while partly praising the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related organizations&#8217; works, primarily related to N. Korea&#8217;s kidnapping of the Japanese.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>After Oct 2022, we have not discussed &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and its related issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>Skim from Oct 2022 to Dec 2022</li>



<li>Every once or twice a week, they mentioned &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and related columns, such as interviewing former followers of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; or Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, viewpoints from professionals.</li>



<li>They worked hard for this problem, but it may be because &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; has cooperated with LDP, and generally, Akahata newspaper tends to criticize LDP.</li>

<h5>My reflection on this reading</h5>



<p>Left-side newspapers tend to criticize conservatives due to &#8220;connection with &#8216;Unification Church&#8217; related organizations,&#8221; however, left-side newspapers often interviewed or introduced &#8220;second-generations&#8221; perspectives. Personally, those &#8220;second generations&#8221; should also be aware of making connections with certain political sides; otherwise, they are doing the same thing as the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did.</p>
