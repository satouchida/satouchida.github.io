<ul>
<li>2022 Feb, no articles mentioning this topic</li>



<li>2022 Mar, some articles touched on the concept of &#8220;family,&#8221; which seems deeply affected by doctrines of the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; yet did not mention the term &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</li>



<li>no mention of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; until 2022 Oct
<ul>
<li>2022 Oct, mentioned &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; in some articles</li>



<li>One mentioned the relationships between religious corporations and LDP since LDP is currently making a coalition with New Komeito, which has Soka Gakkai (Buddhism New Religious Movement in Japan) as a power base</li>



<li>One justified its relationships with the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; arguing how the impact of the church was small for the ruling party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)</li>



<li>One criticized both right and left wings for this problem while partly praising the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related organizations&#8217; works, primarily related to N. Korea&#8217;s kidnapping of the Japanese.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>After Oct 2022, we have not discussed &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and its related issues.</p>

<li>Skim from Oct 2022 to Dec 2022</li>



<li>Every once or twice a week, they mentioned &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and related columns, such as interviewing former followers of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; or Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, viewpoints from professionals.</li>



<li>They worked hard for this problem, but it may be because &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; has cooperated with LDP, and generally, Akahata newspaper tends to criticize LDP.</li>

<h5>My reflection on this reading</h5>



<p>Left-side newspapers tend to criticize conservatives due to &#8220;connection with &#8216;Unification Church&#8217; related organizations,&#8221; however, left-side newspapers often interviewed or introduced &#8220;second-generations&#8221; perspectives. Personally, those &#8220;second generations&#8221; should also be aware of making connections with certain political sides; otherwise, they are doing the same thing as the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did.</p>

<h4>The &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; follower sued the local authority because of a &#8220;violation of Freedom of Faith&#8221;</h4>



<p>On December 16, 2022, one man sued Toyama city because the resolution of terminating the relationship with the former &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; was passed by the Toyama city congress.</p>



<p>The man claimed that Toyama city congressman and congresswoman refused his proposal to bring his petition against this resolution, which violates the right to petition, the fundamental part of democracy.</p>

<h4>&#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; &#8211; Religious Corporations Act Article 78-2</h4>



<ul>
<li>Since January 4, &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; has been attempted twice by Agency for Cultural Affairs under the control of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).</li>



<li>The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology heard the opinions of an advisory council, Religious Corporations Council.</li>



<li> &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; had been added to the article because of terrorism, mainly the Tokyo subway sarin attack, by Aum Shinrikyo but was never attempted until November 22, 2022.</li>
</ul>



<h5>What is the right of &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; or &#8220;questioning right&#8221;</h5>



<p>This right can be exercised if the one who is in a religious organization continuously violates the law or the organization causes serious damage.<br>After examining reports, the minister of MEXT can ask for the order of dissolution of the religious organization for the court. When the court finds a cause, it may order the dissolution of the religious corporation.</p>



<p>The contents of reports and questions will not publish for a certain period because of &#8220;privacy for both sides.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>First Attempt</h5>



<p>The first attempt had excused on November 22, 2022. Based on MEXT, they asked for &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; to answer about the documents related to the operation of the organization, statements, documents, and accounting books related to their assets.</p>



<p>The agency received the answer for Cultural Affairs on December 9, 2022. However, the Agency said the reports from &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; were not enough, so they re-attempted the right on December 14, 2022, again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>Second Attempt</h5>



<p>Since the first attempt could not gain enough information from the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; the Agency for Cultural Affairs re-attempted to exercise &#8220;questioning right&#8221; for the church.</p>

<h3>Read News Articles and Press Conferences by &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Day 2</h3>



<p>As I did yesterday, I would like to continue to catch up on the current situation of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related issues in Japan. For today, I am going to focus on the press conferences and the announcements by the Church. It is a rare opportunity for us to grasp what they perceive and think about the problem, especially related to the &#8220;second generation.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>First Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on July 11th, about an hour</li>



<li>Describe the official view of Mr. Abe&#8217;s assassination of the Church</li>
</ul>



<p>They excused themselves by explaining their doctrine and claimed their innocence for the assassination.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>Second Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on August 10th, about an hour</li>



<li>Their claim for spiritual sales and their political activities</li>
</ul>



<p>At the press conference, the president of the Japanese &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Tomihiro Tanaka, made it clear that they are no more committing to spiritual sales, which was once a social problem in Japan about 40 years ago. He also resorted to the Church getting unreasonable discrimination and hatred rooted in &#8220;biased reporting&#8221; by the media. He said the current environment surrounding the Church violates freedom of religion.</p>



<p>When he talked about &#8220;biased coverage,&#8221; he pointed out that the media only convey the thoughts of &#8220;ex-Moonies&#8221; while omitting the viewpoints or &#8220;success stories&#8221; of pious Moonies.</p>
