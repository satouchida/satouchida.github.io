<p>As I did yesterday, I would like to continue to catch up on the current situation of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related issues in Japan. For today, I am going to focus on the press conferences and the announcements by the Church. It is a rare opportunity for us to grasp what they perceive and think about the problem, especially related to the &#8220;second generation.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">First Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on July 11th, about an hour</li>



<li>Describe the official view of Mr. Abe&#8217;s assassination of the Church</li>
</ul>



<p>They excused themselves by explaining their doctrine and claimed their innocence for the assassination.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Second Press Conference</h5>



<ul>
<li>Held on August 10th, about an hour</li>



<li>Their claim for spiritual sales and their political activities</li>
</ul>



<p>At the press conference, the president of the Japanese &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Tomihiro Tanaka, made it clear that they are no more committing to spiritual sales, which was once a social problem in Japan about 40 years ago. He also resorted to the Church getting unreasonable discrimination and hatred rooted in &#8220;biased reporting&#8221; by the media. He said the current environment surrounding the Church violates freedom of religion.</p>



<p>When he talked about &#8220;biased coverage,&#8221; he pointed out that the media only convey the thoughts of &#8220;ex-Moonies&#8221; while omitting the viewpoints or &#8220;success stories&#8221; of pious Moonies.</p>
