<li>2022 Feb, no articles mentioning this topic</li>



<li>2022 Mar, some articles touched the concept of &#8220;family&#8221; which seems deeply affected by doctrines of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; yet did not mention the term &#8220;Unification Church&#8221;</li>



<li>no mention to &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; untill 2022 Oct
<ul>
<li>2022 Oct, mentioned &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; in some articles</li>



<li>one mentioned the relationships between religious corporations and LDP since LDP is currently making a coalition with New Komeito, which has Soka Gakkai (Buddhism New Religious Movement in Japan) as power base</li>



<li>one justified its relationships with &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; arguing how the impact of the church was small for the ruling party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)</li>



<li>one critisized both right and left wing for this problem while partly praised the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related organizations works, especially related to N. Korea&#8217;s kidnappping of Japanese</li>

<h5>My reflection through this reading</h5>



<p>Left-side newspapers tend to critisize conservatives due to &#8220;connection with &#8216;Unification Church&#8217; related organizations,&#8221; however, left-side newspapers often interviewed or introduced &#8220;second-generations&#8221; perspectives. Personally those &#8220;second-generations&#8221; should also aware of making connections with certain political sides; otherwise they are doing same thing as &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did.</p>

<h4>&#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; &#8211; Religious Corporations Act Article 78-2</h4>



<ul>
<li>Since Janurary 4, &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; has been attempted twice by Agency for Cultural Affairs under controll of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).</li>



<li>The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology heard the opinions of an advisory council, Religious Corporations Council.</li>



<li> &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; had added for the article because of terrorism, mainly tokyo subway sarin attack, by Aum Shinrikyo but was never attempted until Novemver 22, 2022.</li>
</ul>



<h5>What is the right of &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; or &#8220;questioning right&#8221;</h5>



<p>This right can be excercised if the one who are in religious organization continuously violates law or the organization caused serious damage.<br>After examining reports, the minister of MEXT can ask order of dissolution of the religious organization for the court. When the court finds a cause, it may order the dissolution of the religious corporation.</p>



<p>The contents of reports and questions will not publish for certain period because of &#8220;privacy for both sides.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>First Attempt</h5>



<p>First Attempt had excused on November 22, 2022. Based on MEXT, they asked for &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; to answer about the documents related to operation of organization, statements, documents and acconting book related to thier assets.</p>



<p>The answer was recieved by Agency for Cultural Affairs on December 9, 2022. However, the Agency said the reports from &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; were not enough, so they re-attempted the right on December 14, 2022 again.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h5>Second Attempt</h5>



<p>Since the first attempt could not gain enough information from &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; the Agency for Cultural Affairs re-attempted excersicing &#8220;questioning right&#8221; for the church.</p>

<p>Today I found I can use cloud server to run this program and it makes easier the project.</p>



<p>However, since Twitter&#8217;s problem, I can&#8217;t verify my twtter developer account for last few days (I&#8217;m writing this on Jan 5). So I just read and summarize on current news about &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; for next few days.</p>



<p><strong><em>Updated on Jan 8</em></strong><br>Finally Twitter sent me the verification code, so I run the code below. However it said I need Elevated access to run this script, so I am now requesting Eleveted API access for Twitter. FAQ and developer forum suggests it usually takes less than a week.</p>



<p>For example, I will run the script below to correct tweets related to &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Correcting Twitter data as a piece of public opinion</h3>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>From today, I am going to work on correcting Twitter posts related to &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and &#8220;Second Generation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.ipsj.or.jp/dp/contents/publication/41/S1101-R1802.html#link12">this</a> project, I will use &#8220;Kotoriotoko&#8221; to gather twitter posts. This is open source software build by Japanese scholars, and seems easy to run. However, since I aim to gather two different but overlapping concepts, I need two separate computers that can run this program 24/7. Fortunately I have one old computer that I barely use, so first computer would be that one. For my second computer, I could buy new small computer for this research using new year discounts or borrow unused computer from group home.</p>



<p>I could not verify my phone number to Twitter account which I want to use, so I am going to get another phone number for this project and one-month trip to Japan.</p>

<h2>1. Abstract</h2>



<h5>Background Concepts</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The child guidance center must take action, including temporary custody, to secure the child&#8217;s safety when a custodian commits &#8220;child abuse&#8221; (used in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act) based on the faith of particular religion or belief system (Inspiration or any other method that is almost impossible to demonstrate and that arouses personal fear.)</p>



<p>When the center finds a possibility of ongoing child abuse, they are required to judge comprehensively, including the situations of children and custodians, such as living environment, rather than following examples from the Q&amp;A section. The judgment must be made by the children&#8217;s side.</p>
</blockquote>



<h5>The response for those other than custodians</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Abuse of a child could be punished by applying Penal Code such as Assault, Indecency through Compulsion, Abandonment by a Person Responsible for Their Care, and anyone dictating or advising these acts for custodians could constitute co-principals, inducements, or accessories; thus, one should accuse the case for police timely.</p>

<h2>3. Points to be considered for response to abuse and encouraging independence</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>It is highly possible that children who experienced abuse related to religion are strongly affected by religious doctrine</em></strong> and find it hard to recognize and appeal to their situation, which has problems. Assessing their environment objectively and explaining or instructing the definition of child abuse for children and guardians.<br>However, <strong><em>because the guidance might not be enough to change the behavior or thoughts of custodians based on religious doctrine against children, and there are concerns that the escalation of abusing by custodians or intervening for a family from religious organizations with the guidance as a trigger</em></strong>, securing the children&#8217;s safety is the priority so that taking temporary custody pursuant without hesitation will be necessary if needed.</li>



<li>If those who the age over 18 years old come to talk about their problem, introducing the use of Youth Independent Assistance Homes (kind of group home) and discussing the next steps following their mind is required. If they do not seek to use Youth Independent Assistance Homes, <strong><em>proactive outreaching is required despite their age</em></strong> (in japan, youths over 18 years considered as adult). List up and organize their particular problems and build a connection with the Japan Legal Support Center, welfare offices, or other sorts of related institutions/organizations.</li>



<li>In case of judging whether each issue is child abuse or not, the child guidance center must make a decision examining multiple sides such as children&#8217;s condition, guardians&#8217; condition, and living environments; thus, <strong><em>it can be child abuse if there are only minor actions</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Read News Articles and Press Conferences by &#8220;Unification Church&#8221;, Day 2</h3>



<p>As I did yesterday, I would like to continue to catch up on the current situation of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related issues in Japan. For today, I am going to focus on the press conferences and the announcements by the Church. It is a rare opportunity for us to grasp what they perceive and think about the problem, especially related to the &#8220;second generation.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Held at July 11th, about a hour</li>



<li>Describe the official view of Mr. Abe&#8217;s assassination of the Church</li>
</ul>



<p>Basically, they excused themselves by explaining their doctrine and claimed their innocence for the assassination.</p>

<li>Held at August 10th, about a hour</li>



<li>Their claim for spiritual sales and their political activities</li>
</ul>



<p>At the press conference, the president of the Japanese &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Tomihiro Tanaka, made it clear that they are no more committing to spiritual sales, which was once a social problem in Japan about 40 years ago. He also resorted to the Church getting unreasonable discrimination and hatred rooted in &#8220;biased reporting&#8221; by the media. He said the current environment surrounding the Church violates freedom of religion.</p>



<p>When he talked about &#8220;biased coverage,&#8221; he pointed out that the media only convey the thoughts of &#8220;ex-Moonies&#8221; while omitting the viewpoints or &#8220;success stories&#8221; of pious Moonies.</p>

<h3>Read News Articles and Press Conferences by &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; &#8211; Day 1</h3>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>Since I have not been in Japan for about four months, I am not knowledgeable about the current situation in Japan. Thus, I decided to read some articles about the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; from mainstream media.</p>



<p>Before starting my journal, I would like to convey the use of the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; in Japan. Pious believers of &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; are known as &#8220;Moonies&#8221; in English, and they changed their name to &#8220;The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification&#8221; for the sake of erasing its notoriety. However, because the term &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; is widely recognized in Japan, the media continues to use &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the next five to eight days, I will read as many Japanese articles for several fields and summarize them in English. The summarization would be the journal for the first days of Japan since</p>



<ol>
<li>Prevent spreading COVID, R.S.V., flu around by interviewing people in-person;</li>



<li>Re-capping current Japanese media&#8217;s attitude towards the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and its related problems;</li>



<li>Jet lag might not allow me to behave like those in Japan.</li>
</ol>



<p>Today, I will focus on the dynamic changes in the media&#8217;s way of presenting this issue to the public.</p>



<p>The situation surrounding media have been shifting quickly. Before I left Japan, most of the media didn&#8217;t mention the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Instead, they called it &#8220;the Religious Group.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know why they didn&#8217;t say about the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; despite the media from the US or Europe mentioning the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; or &#8220;Moonies&#8221; at that moment. However, this weird regard didn&#8217;t last long.</p>



<p>On July 11th, the head of the Church&#8217;s Japanese organization held a press conference to express their official statements with a &#8220;selected&#8221; medium. After the first conference, all the TVs and newspapers started to use &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; because finally they could convey both sides information about the problem. After the conference, the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; organized some conferences so tomorrow, I will focus on these events and other announcements from the Church.</p>
