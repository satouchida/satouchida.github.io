<p>The 3D printer is no longer expensive unless you are looking for something super fast or precise. I got my Kobra 2 (not Neo, Pro, Plus, Max etc) from eBay, where Anycubic&#8217;s official store listed refurbished printers. It was only 79 bucks. So I ordered it for my Winter Term project. Despite financial aid being reduced for on-campus projects (it was 1000, now 500 bucks), it was cheap enough. Easily installed in my space. Then, why not print something? So I did, without knowing a series of issues were waiting for me. Takeaway message: There is always a reason for a price that is too good to be real. If you have a fat budget and are not a fan of problem-solving, just get the so-called “best” printer for an easy and smooth setup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First: the z-offset auto probe was not functioning at all. Kobra 2 comes with a dedicated button that measures the distance between the base and the nozzle. I am a person who reads manuals, so I followed each step carefully before the test print. Then I pressed “print.” The nozzle ended up scratching the print bed with tangled PLA. First, I conducted a manual probe. It worked, but not perfect. I made sure all the screws were tightened, flashed the newest official firmware, used official PLA, slowed down the printing speed, calibrated slight inclinations of the extruder(heater), print bed, and rails, … And I still got imperfect quality prints. Finally I focused on the hot end that looked slightly wrong compared to the official image. It was the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0PCCx-E9wk?si=JfrppPiUm1Rh_ILa">Replace the hotend for Anycubic Kobra 2 Series</a> (Link to YouTube) The top comment saved my life &#8211; the PTFE tube was too long in my Kobra 2.</p>



<p> <img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe2tOZZUWQwqXVvBvBLnpwoSxKkmeDS7eN2pd1dYvcOIsFU5p-fv12seZh8YPs3FOULxRpQ-jdAmDKBbVRDDfrLAJuGgEW1fD2ZZoS0X16z9osVRVW9-_ZwXk-As9V5go3gX14jtw?key=eUSgf_0uE9Np_s-K31efuZTS" style="" alt="It saved my life. The comment says: &quot;Two things they don't cover here that are absolutely crucial for success

1. The PTFE tube might be too long
2. The nozzle assembly has to be seated properly otherwise it will be too low and hit your bed

At 1:11, take a look at the cylinder coming out of the hotend and into the hotend assembly.  That little protusion (whatever it is called) has to be flush with the bottom of the assembly.  The factory replacement I received had a PTFE tube that was ever so slightly too long and as a result, the nozzle stuck out too far and crashed into the bed.  I had to trim 1.5mm off the PTFE tube and that allowed me to seat the new hotend properly.&quot;"></p>



<p>This is why you should look at everything you can find on the internet before you throw it up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I installed the Klipper after a few prints with an official firmware, and now it is working flawlessly. Here is my printer.cfg and variables.cfg for klipper, based on function3d and crororo’s config files. (1) I also uploaded my PrusaSlicer settings for 15% wood PLA filament from SUNLU and 8% carbon fiber PETG from Polymaker. They work perfectly in my environment. <a href="https://github.com/satouchida/anycubic-Kobra-2-klipper">Link to github repo is here</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote down my thoughts about current media coverage of this problem in both Japanese and English.</p>



<p>個人的に気になる点がいくつもあるので書き残しておきます。日本語は後半にあります。 If you are interested in original Japanese expression, please use <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator">DeepL Translator</a>.</p>

<li><a href="#sec-1-en">The use of &#8220;second generation&#8221; in media</a></li>

</ol>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="sec-1-en">The use of &#8220;second generation&#8221; in media</h6>



<p>I think the word &#8220;second generation&#8221; used in Japanese media includes too many groups. Based on my observation, the current use of &#8220;second generation&#8221; implies negative nuance. However, as long as I know, several &#8220;second generation&#8221; are living happily. I don&#8217;t try to justify child abuse, but I will not say being &#8220;second generation&#8221; is unfortunate unless they complain or feel dissatisfied. Imposing to &#8220;know&#8221; something &#8220;in general&#8221; sounds similar to teaching only one religious belief as &#8220;Truth.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t come up with alternatives for the words &#8220;second generation,&#8221; but it needs more attention to nurture understanding of this problem in Japanese society.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="sec-2-en">Some radical measure proposals under the name of protecting children</h6>



<p>I think my freedom of thought and freedom of religion was violated as a &#8220;second generation&#8221; of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. Thus, I appreciate the guideline from MHLW and hope it is enforced in Japan effectively. However, there are some movements from several groups (whether political or not) with more strict guidelines, including intervention in the family. As an individual who believes violated my freedom of thought previously, I strongly support freedom of thought. Because of that, I cannot accept the authority intervening in the family, which consists of the smallest unit in the democratic society. Maybe it sounds conservative, and I still struggle with wrapping up my thought in regard to this problem.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="sec-3-en">The media coverage</h6>



<p>At least for Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, an eschatological group, the ongoing situation might look like proof of the near-end days in their dogma. Although I have spent about four years without faith, I am sometimes scared because of what&#8217;s happening. For active Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, I cannot imagine how they are feeling now.<br>And current media seems to be consuming the problem for their profit. I worried this problem would be forgotten as other important topics in Japan.</p>

<li><a href="#sec-3">宗教弾圧とも取れる報道のあり方</a></li>
</ol>



<p>それぞれについて。</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="sec-1">「宗教二世」問題という呼称</h6>



<p>宗教二世という呼称は、あまりに多くの集団を含みすぎているのではないか。僕が知っている限りで、エホバの証人に残り幸せを享受している二世・三世の方々はそれなりにいる。もちろんそこに虐待がないかと言われればそうは言い切れない。しかし本人が幸せであるなら、本人を「保護」するのではなく虐待的な育児から離れるよう親を動かす指導・説得なのではないか？野球部でパワハラや暴力があったから野球部を辞めさせましょう、本人は辞めたくないと言っているけど関係ありませんという親がいたら僕は流石に強引だと止める。そこでなければ幸せになれないかもしれない。少なくとも僕は、成長して広い世界を知るにつれて不幸になっていったと思っている。知らないでいることが幸せかもしれない。「知ること」を押し付けるのは、今叩かれている宗教の押し付けと大して変わらないのではないか。（「知ること」は一般常識や日本の社会体制、現代科学への信頼などをざっくり表現したくて使ってます）この上で、宗教二世/二世信者＝被害者のようにラベリングしている現在の報道にはあまり良い感情を抱いていない。だからと言って代わりになんと呼べばいいかと言われれば分からない。ただ、僕は違和感を覚えている。</p>



<p></p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="sec-2">信教の自由、思想の自由を無視した対策の提言</h6>



<p>この点はどれだけ考えても答えが出ないので触れないでおこうとも思ったが、現在の自分の考えを書き留めておく。僕はエホバの証人の二世として育ち、信教の自由を侵害されたと考えている。だが、宗教を子どもから取り上げようとか「宗教の信仰等に関係する児童虐待等」のガイドラインで規定されている行為を超えて宗教活動に子どもが関わっていたら児相に通告しようと言った考えには反対する。僕はこの社会も一種の宗教のようなものに従って動いていると理解している。法律を破ると罰がある、科学はだいたい正しい(←コロナ絡みでだいぶ怪しくなったけど)、みたいな。それを信仰している人が多数派だから今の社会は回ってて、少数派の宗教が問題になるのも多数派から外れすぎているから。虐待だって、それを規定する考えや言葉が多数派に受け入れられなければ存在しないはずだ。ついでに、信教の自由を侵害されたと思い込んでいる人間として、信教の自由と思想の自由は守られなければならないと強く信じている。国家権力がこの領域、とくに家族に踏み込むことは絶対にだめだと信じている。さらに僕の考えだが、日本という国がそこに踏み込んだらいいことが起きないと思っている。もう少し日本を信頼していたら、フランスのホームスクール禁止レベルの介入はしてもいいと言っていただろう。まぁ、個人の考えです。</p>



<p></p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="sec-3">宗教弾圧とも取れる報道のあり方</h6>



<p>この点が一番の懸念だ。少なくともエホバの証人にとって。彼らの教義は終末論的だが、その流れをざっくり説明するとこう。今は終わりの日で、もうすぐ終わりが来る。終わりが来る前に、世界中を天災が襲い、エホバの証人以外の宗教がありとあらゆる国家権力によって弾圧され、「平和だ、安全だ」と宣言がある。その後エホバの証人が弾圧され始めたらキリストが臨在し地上を楽園にしていく。今の流れは、ちょうど宗教弾圧のところに見えるのだ。異常気象、戦争、宗教弾圧。ここまではっきり終わりの日のしるしが見えたら信仰を捨てたはずの僕でさえ怖くなる。それは置いておいても、日本社会における宗教のイメージが悪くなってしまうことを危惧している。僕は、宗教は必要だと強く信じている。信仰を求めて彷徨っていた頃、ある正教会の信仰者の方が僕におっしゃった「年老いて必要を感じたら来ればいい」という言葉の通りだ。共同体としての宗教は、今の日本にこそ必要なのかもしれないとさえ考えている。宗教は悪ではない。宗教だから距離を置く、霊的なものを遠ざける。そんなものは対策でも何もない、問題の先送りだろう。さらに、現在の報道はこの問題を消費しているように感じる。結局モリカケや今まで忘れ去られてきた問題のように、消えていくのではないか。</p>



<p>ざっくり書き殴っただけなので、細かい表現とか多少の読みにくさは見逃してください。今後も時間があるときに見直すつもりです。(最終更新: 2023/2/5)</p>

<p>This winter term project was exciting and stressful at the same time. The topic I chose is very controversial, and I found myself in a conflict between different myselfs. Part of me believes the law should protect children, but another part of me believes government should not interrupt religious activities. Reading news reports and governmental statements also deeply shook my mind because those documents include really realistic descriptions of spiritual abuse or physical, sexual, and psychological abuse and neglect. That also made me depressed, but I think this kind of issue accompanies this. I realized how hard it would be if I chose to study in this field, which is one thing I gained from the project.</p>



<p>Despite the depressive nature of the research, I found it interesting because it directly relates to human rights. Human rights are somewhat vague to me, but I am living because of that rights. Then, how far can individuals exceed the rights against other individuals&#8217; rights or laws? This question also shaped the thesis of my undergraduate education so far: how to balance fundamental rights in society. I especially want to explore eastern societies, such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, when I mention &#8220;the society.&#8221; Those countries encourage individual rights, which sounds very western, while consciously or unconsciously maintaining eastern or ancient Chinese ethics. I wish to study fundamental rights and how society works with broader perspectives, including religion, psychology, math, and more.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Abstract</h3>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h4>



<p>The public interest in the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; has been one of the most influential factors in supporting those who experienced spiritual abuse in Japan since almost no attention had been paid before the assassination of Shinzo Abe. TV shows, newspapers, and tabloids eagerly report the news because of the high public interest in the organization. It means a decrease in the public interest against the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; directly affects supporting those who have been spiritually abused. Analyzing the huge number of queries gathered by Google services reveals the public interest in the &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Objectives</h4>



<p>Using Google Trends, I studied the public interest in queries towards <em>unification</em>, <em>unification church</em>, <em>former unification church</em>, and <em>family federation</em>. Each word is originally Japanese. I hypothesize that these data may be correlated with the assassination of Shinzo Abe and upcoming reports about the &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Methods</h4>



<p>Google Trends was employed to normalize search queries on Google Search, Youtube Search, and Google News on a scale from 0 (includes 0% to &lt;1% of the peak volume) to 100 (peak of traffic) presented as weekly relative search volume (RSV) treating <em>unification</em>, <em>unification church</em>, <em>former unification church</em>, and <em>family federation</em> as search terms. A search time series covered the last 260 weeks (January 2018 to January 2023), and the RSV of all terms was compared with their weekly volumes. Respective trendlines were employed to estimate overall trends.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Results</h4>



<p>I found a dramatic trend immediately after the assassination of Shinzo Abe, but it shrunk quickly. Before the assassination, there was almost no interest in the &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; while Shinzo Abe and other ruling party members attended events held by the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and its related organizations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusions</h4>



<p>Considering these findings, it may be reasonable to say the media have consumed the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; related reports. After a certain period that those media conveyed sensational reports, public interest in the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; shrunk. This investigation utilized Youtube queries, Google search, and Google News; thus, it would include those who gain information mainly from Youtube and other video platforms.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h4>



<p>Jan 23, MHLW announced they did administrative guidance against the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; because of their work as an adoption agency, which they did not register. Japanese law dictates adoption agencies register for children&#8217;s adoption. So the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; did illegal work, and this had been questioning by attempting &#8220;Requesting Reports and Asking Questions&#8221; or &#8220;questioning right.&#8221;</p>



<p>I used DeepL translator for this translation since I did not have enough time for this work.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding adoptions, etc.</h6>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>On December 9, 2022, we issued a &#8220;Notice Concerning Compliance with the Law-related the Protection of Children in the Mediation of Adoptions by Private Adoption Agencies&#8221; (Office Communication, Family Welfare Division, Child and Family Bureau, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, dated December 9, 2022) to your organization.</p>



<p>The Government of Japan is continuing to investigate the facts about adoptions that have taken place in the past among the followers of your organization. The Law Concerning Protection of Children in Adoption Proceedings by Private Mediation Agencies (Law No. 110 of 2016, hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Mediation Law&#8221;) The following notice is given with the understanding that the purpose of the Law-related Protection of Children and Promotion of Welfare of Children (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Adoption Mediation Law&#8221;) and the Law Concerning Protection of Children in Relation to Adoption Mediation by Private Mediation Agencies (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Mediation Law&#8221;) is to protect children and promote their welfare.</p>



<p>The following is the notice.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>1 Purpose of the Law</strong></p>



<p><em>(1) Positioning of the right to be fostered by the biological parents and adoption</em></p>



<p>Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates that a child &#8220;has the right to be known and to be cared for by his or her parents as far as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>Article 1 of the Child Welfare Law stipulates that &#8220;every child has the right to be properly cared for in accordance with the spirit of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (abbreviated) and to have other welfare equally guaranteed&#8221;, and Article 3-2 stipulates that the national and local governments shall &#8220;ensure that children are raised in their homes in good health, both physically and mentally. In addition, Article 3-2 stipulates that &#8220;the national and local governments shall support the guardians of children so that children are brought up in their families in good mental and physical health. However, in cases where it is difficult or inappropriate to take care of a child at home, necessary measures shall be taken to ensure that the child is continuously taken care of in a child-rearing environment similar to that of the child&#8217;s home. In this case, it is stated that &#8220;the Child Welfare Law, etc., shall be applied to the child. In this case, the &#8220;promulgation of the Act for Partial Revision of the Child Welfare Act, etc.&#8221; (Hoyu Kodomo Houkokusho No. 0603/1, 2016) states that &#8220;home&#8221; refers to an environment where the child is cared for by his/her biological parents or relatives, and &#8220;a child-rearing environment similar to that in a home&#8221; refers to a home through adoption, etc.</p>



<p>Thus, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Japan has ratified, and the Child Welfare Law clearly stipulate that children have the right to be cared for by their biological parents as much as possible.</p>



<p>The Adoption Mediation Law also stipulates that &#8220;a license system shall be established for persons engaged in the adoption agency business, and measures shall be taken to ensure the proper operation of such business, thereby protecting children involved in the adoption agency business of private agencies, and at the same time, promoting proper adoption mediation by private agencies. The Act was enacted as a legislative act by the Diet members for the purpose of &#8220;contributing to the promotion of the welfare of children by taking measures to ensure that children are protected in the adoption proceedings by private agencies, and by promoting appropriate adoption proceedings by private agencies.</p>



<p>Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Law stipulates that &#8220;the adoption mediation shall be conducted with the best interests of the child in mind and in conformity with the best interests of the child&#8221; and the &#8220;Notice on the Enforcement of the Law Concerning Protection of Children in Adoption Mediation by Private Mediation Agencies (Notice)&#8221; (November 27, 2017 Child No. 1127, No. 4) was enacted as a legislative measure. In the &#8220;Notice on the Enforcement of the Act on the Protection of Children in Relation to the Mediation of Adoption by Private Mediation Agencies (Notice No. 1127-4 of November 27, 2017),&#8221; it is stated that &#8220;the significance of the adoption system in child welfare is to provide a warm home to a child who has no guardian or is disadvantaged and to provide legal stability to the child&#8217;s care, thereby ensuring the sound development of the child, and adoption shall be conducted solely from the perspective of the child&#8217;s welfare. Adoption must be conducted solely from the perspective of the welfare of the child.</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>(2) Interpretation of &#8220;Mediation&#8221; and &#8220;Business&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In the same Enforcement Notice, the term &#8220;mediation&#8221; for adoption means &#8220;&#8216;to mediate between a prospective adoptive parent and a child and to talk to the child as a third party in order to facilitate the conclusion of the adoption&#8217; and is not a requirement for the conclusion of the adoption. In addition, the term &#8216;third party&#8217; shall mean a person who is a parent of the child or the child&#8217;s father or mother (including a person who is to become the child&#8217;s father or mother as a result of the birth of the child) and a person who is a prospective adoptive parent of the child. Hereinafter referred to as &#8220;parents of the child&#8221;) or the child&#8217;s parents. Or a person other than the child&#8217;s father or mother who has the right of care for the child (including a person who is to become the person who has the right of care for the child due to the birth of the child). The communication between the child and a person other than the child&#8217;s parents (including a person who should have the right to custody of the child due to the birth of the child) regarding information on both parties shall fall under the category of adoption mediation.&#8221; The adoption agency is required to &#8220;provide information on the adoption of a child&#8221;. The &#8220;conclusion of adoption&#8221; here refers to the point in time when the family court grants permission for an ordinary adoption in accordance with Article 798 of the Civil Code (Law No. 89 of 1896) or when a special adoption in accordance with Article 817-2, Paragraph 1 of the same Code is concluded. The term &#8220;conclusion of adoption&#8221; does not refer to the point in time when the prospective adoptee and the birth parents of the child to be adopted reach an agreement on the adoption of the child. In addition, in the same notice, it is stated that &#8220;the adoption of a child by a person who has been adopted by both parties is considered to be mediation.</p>



<p>In addition, the same notice states that &#8220;under this Act, the term &#8216;adoption agency business&#8217; refers to the act of mediating adoptions as a business. The term &#8220;carrying on as a business&#8221; means to carry out the same kind of activities repeatedly and continuously for a certain purpose, and even if it is a one-time act, it has the nature of a business if carried out with the intention of repeating the same kind of activities. Examples of cases in which a business should be considered to be a business are those that advertise that they provide adoption services, those that have an office and show signs that they provide adoption services, and those that have an office and show signs that they provide adoption services.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Examples of cases in which a business should be considered to be an adoption agency are when it advertises that it is an adoption agency or when it has an office and posts a sign that it is an adoption agency. In addition, the law also states that a commercial adoption agency may not be engaged in the adoption of children for profit. In addition, it is stipulated in Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Adoption Mediation Law that a person who intends to engage in the adoption agency business for profit cannot be licensed as a private adoption agency, and the giving and receiving of money is not relevant in determining whether or not a person is engaged in the &#8220;adoption agency business.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>2 Comments from those who have been adopted through adoption among believers of your organization</strong></p>



<p>After the media report on November 15, 2022, that your organization may be engaged in the adoption agency business without obtaining permission from the prefectural governor, we received comments from several people who were adopted through adoptions between believers of your organization, including their own experiences, their current feelings based on their experiences, and their opinions. Many of them said, &#8220;The birth parents are the ones who are the ones who are the most important. Many of them said, &#8220;If my birth parents gave me up for adoption because they could not raise me, I could understand, but if they could raise me but abandoned me, I wish they had never given me up at all,&#8221; &#8220;I used my life and my life to fulfill their teachings,&#8221; &#8220;My birth parents could have raised me, but they gave me up for adoption, and that hurt me so much,&#8221; &#8220;What is wrong with me? I would not have been born if it were not for the teachings of the church, which encourages having many children and giving them up for adoption.</p>



<p>If it were not for the teachings of the church, which encourages the birth and adoption of many children, I would not have been born. These people&#8217;s voices showed that their biological parents (birth parents) were not able to raise them and that they had no compassion.</p>



<p>The fact that they were adopted while their other siblings were being raised by their birth parents was deeply damaging to the children&#8217;s hearts after they grew up.</p>



<p>In addition, some of them said, &#8220;I want this to stop from the child&#8217;s point of view. I don&#8217;t want the next victim to suffer from the same mental pain as I did. </p>



<p><strong>3. Thorough Enforcement of Compliance with Laws and Regulations, etc. at Your Organization</strong></p>



<p>In the &#8220;Handbook on the Righteous Life for Blessed Families&#8221; (revised edition, 4th printing, published on January 31, 2019), which is published by your corporation, it is stated that &#8220;the offering of a child for adoption to a childless family is a beautiful tradition of the Family Association for World Peace and Unification in the sense that we can realize God&#8217;s family ideal together, centering on God&#8217;s love. It is a beautiful tradition of the United Families for World Peace and Unification.&#8221; &#8220;Families who have received the blessings of children from Heaven have the responsibility to share these blessings with families without children,&#8221; etc.</p>



<p>On the other hand, as mentioned above, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Child Welfare Law state that children have the right to be cared for by their parents as much as possible, and that adoption should be considered when it is difficult or inappropriate for the biological parents to care for the child.</p>



<p>The handbook also states, &#8220;Once an agreement is reached between both families, it must be reported to the Family Education Bureau. The handbook also states, &#8220;Once both families have reached an agreement, it must be reported to the Family Education Department; it should not be done by both families, or by the parish or church alone, or after the adoption ceremony. Once both families have reached an agreement, submit the &#8220;Application for Adoption&#8221; and family photo to the Family Education Department at Headquarters for approval by the president. After approval, the Family Education Department at Headquarters will contact both families and the head of the family department and their church will be notified by the Family Education Bureau. In addition, &#8220;Basically, all expenses related to the birth (regular medical checkups, etc.) are to be paid by the adoptee. However, until approval is received from the Family Education Department, no money will be given or received.&#8221; &#8220;It is necessary to have the head of the church and the head of the family department attend the birth and confirm that both families are in agreement on what to do in case of any health problems with the child,&#8221; etc.</p>



<p>On the other hand, as mentioned above, &#8220;mediation&#8221; of adoption under the Mediation Law means &#8220;to mediate between the prospective adoptive parents and the child and to take care of the child as a third party so that the adoption will be completed smoothly,&#8221; and it is considered to be &#8220;mediation&#8221; if it involves contacting both parties for information or taking care of the child even after both parties have reached an agreement to ensure the adoption will be completed smoothly. In addition, such &#8220;mediation&#8221; is considered to be a form of &#8220;mediation. Furthermore, if the agency advertises that it provides such &#8220;mediation&#8221; (i.e., facilitates adoptions), it is considered to be a business.</p>



<p>The handbook begins by stating, &#8220;It is the basis of our liturgy, so let us do our utmost to put it into practice. It is believed that believers refer to this handbook as the basis of their life of faith. On the other hand, the above statement in the handbook does not assume that children have the right to be cared for by their parents as much as possible, and there is a concern that believers may understand that adoption is arranged within your corporation.</p>



<p>In light of the aforementioned understanding of the parties involved in adoptions, as well as the purpose and content of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Child Welfare Law, and the Mediation Law, we ask that you comply with all laws and regulations and ensure that no acts that would constitute adoption agency business are conducted within your organization, and that you reiterate in your publications and other materials the purpose and content of the laws and regulations. We also request that you ensure that your publications and other materials appropriately describe the purpose of the laws and regulations.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jan 17</h4>



<p>After graduating high school, I made an appointment with one professor who specialized in mind control by &#8220;cults&#8221; such as Aum or &#8220;Unification Church.&#8221; He is very kind to me and invited me to join one of his classes for graduate students.</p>



<p>It was before the assassination of Shinzo Abe, so I was just one of the rare examples of those who have experienced spiritual abuse by parents, and luckily Japanese Child Consultation Center (CPS-like organization) decided to take me from my parents. I learned many things from him and his students. The examples are how to investigate the impact of spiritual abuse or the existence of a research center that focuses on conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>It was the final period in Japan, so he and his students seemed very busy, but they warmly accepted me. One of his students is working on investigating the longer effect of spiritual abuse by surveying former followers of &#8220;Unification Church,&#8221; Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Happy Sciences, and some other new religions in Japan. I briefly reviewed the draft of the questionnaire and gave some advice on the use of languages.</p>



<p>After that, the professor talked about the current situation. He worried about the decrease of public interest in the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and spiritual abuse since the Japanese government currently seems they want to stop discussing this problem more because they made a &#8220;rescue bill,&#8221; which he thinks is not enough. But he worked for the guideline for Spiritual and close sorts of Child Abuse by MHLW, and we both feel it is enough to help children and youths who are suffering.</p>



<p>However, since he is a Social Psychologist, he knows few psychologists can deal with this complex problem. Because of that, he now aims to seek a way to increase the number of psychologists who have basic knowledge about religion and spiritual abuse through their education while trying to increase the number of students who want to be a psychologist.</p>



<p>Finally, he said it is very precious that I, who have experienced spiritual abuse and its after-effects while interested in spiritual abuse and advocating individual rights, am studying outside of Japan because this studying opportunity will give me a new perspective that cannot be gained from Japan. I don&#8217;t know how or if I have contributed to this problem so far, but I can definitely work on that in the future.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jan 15</h4>



<p>We met at the nearest shopping center of us. She was one of my referees of me when I won a scholarship from a Japanese foundation, Grew-Bancroft, and she has worked for me since I joined my previous residence after I left my home. We have kept in touch during the fall semester, so it is natural for us to meet in person.</p>



<p>At the table, we mainly talked about our shared interest: spiritual abuse from the parents. Because of the publication of the guideline for Spiritual and close sorts of Child Abuse by the government, we discussed my current academic interest and college life in general. Both of us appreciate the guideline since it will help those suffering spiritual abuse. Still, we are worried about the lack of experts who can deal with these irregular types of abuses.</p>



<p>Also, while I am worrying about the politicization of the argument about the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; and spiritual abuse, she accepted its politicization because she believes it is the best and fastest way to rescue those who are suffering.</p>



<p>When it comes to political standpoints of us, I feel I am a little bit conservative left while she seems liberal of liberal. Because of that, she is wholeheartedly working to advocate for children&#8217;s rights. I also wish to expand children&#8217;s rights, but I don&#8217;t feel the current Japanese situation is healthy. Japanese ruling and opposition parties seem to depend on one-sided information and purge one religious corporation. Although the &#8220;Unification Church&#8221; has deceived many people through spiritual sales and illegal preaching, it is one of the certified religious corporations in Japan. I think I should respect it while enforcing the law against its illegal behaviors.</p>



<p>Because of this kind of thought, I decided to read right-wing magazines and seek what Japanese right wings are thinking about this problem. When I told this plan for her, she was interested in that and said please teach me when you find something interesting.</p>



<p>It was only dinner, so that we couldn&#8217;t talk much. But I think I found some interesting different perspectives from her. In this short but prolific conversation, I decided to focus on the interest for this problem based on right/left wings.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Jan 10</h4>



<p>Today I met with my friend, who is studying at International Christian University as a senior. She finally decided to major in Anthropology, but she was also interested in advocation for children. She has worked on Save the Children Japan and advocated for educating the treatment of children&#8217;s rights.</p>



<p>We talked about many things, especially those related to our future careers. Because she is a senior, she has been working on job applications while I have just finished my first semester as a college student. But one thing we have in common: the undescribable anxiety for our future. Thus we spent a lot of time on this topic.</p>



<p>Anyway, about spiritual abuse. She seemed to focus more on supporting while the child is in the family and after the child leaves their family. Since I have experienced living in a group home, she talked about the quality of a group home.</p>



<p>My group home is awesome &#8211; of course, I am biased. But I heard very bad rumors from other group homes and rarely saw news articles reporting abuse in the group home, which should be a safe place for children.</p>



<p>And she said, &#8220;I guess some welfare workers treat children badly because they think of themselves as &#8216;who are helping the misery child&#8217; to some extent.&#8221; I agree with that. However, I do not know how to prevent that kind of person from getting a position in the group home. In Japan, almost any kind of welfare institution is always recruiting workers despite not having enough money to run the group home easily.</p>



<p>My group home, though, have a lot of money and has some lawyers working for children. The founder of the corporation which runs my group home seems very good at finding and gathering the people they need. But not every corporation is like that. Some institutions are suffering from a lack of money. Others are doing everything they can to hire. We concluded we should consider these problems while discussing treating spiritually abused children.</p>
